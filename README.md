# Hi there 👋

My name's Grant, and thanks for visiting my profile!

I'm a **Beginner Vulnerability Researcher** with a passion for offensive security and network diagnostics.

### 📚 My Journey So Far

I am currently focusing on building a fundamental understanding of penetration testing methodologies and system defense. While I am actively learning and exploring new technologies, I am new to the field and openly acknowledge that my experience is still very limited.

In my free time, I attempt to apply my skills through live environment testing, including participating in **bug bounty programs on HackerOne**.

My current areas of focus include systems security and working within Linux environments. I'd love to offer any contribution I can to the security community.

> **Open to Feedback:** If you see anything in my repositories that could be improved, please feel free to open an issue or reach out. I appreciate constructive criticism as a valuable part of the learning process!
